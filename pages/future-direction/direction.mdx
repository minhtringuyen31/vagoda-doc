## Development Directions

To address these issues, future considerations may include using large language models trained on smaller datasets but still ensuring responsiveness, such as llama-2.7b or llama-2.13b. Subsequent fine-tuning with e-commerce-specific datasets would enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of AI features while reducing reliance on third-party services and optimizing costs.

For image generation models, it is necessary to upgrade server configurations and fine-tune models to reduce resource demands and optimize response times.

An important development direction is to build an additional admin website. This site would provide management tools, monitoring, and optimization for system operations, allowing administrators to easily track and adjust features and services according to real needs. Additionally, optimizing the source code, using compression techniques and data caching, and improving network infrastructure are essential to enhance user experience. Solutions for load balancing, database optimization, and distributed architectures should be implemented to ensure stable and efficient system performance under high load conditions. Moreover, establishing a performance monitoring and reporting system is crucial for quickly detecting and resolving issues.

By applying these measures, the system will significantly improve its competitiveness and better meet the real-world needs of the e-commerce sector.
