## Discussion and Limitations

The current project relies on third-party services, particularly large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4. While GPT-4 offers powerful natural language processing capabilities, it remains a general-purpose model with limitations in providing specialized responses. This may affect the effectiveness and accuracy of AI features when applied to specific tasks in e-commerce. Furthermore, the costs associated with third-party services can impact the platform's business efficiency when widely utilized.

Image generation models require substantial infrastructure to ensure quality and response speed. However, the current system cannot meet these infrastructure requirements, leading to slower processing speeds. This impacts user experience and operational effectiveness.

For the existing website, page transitions are not as smooth as desired, and there has been no assessment or measurement of load capacity and scalability to accommodate a large number of users.
