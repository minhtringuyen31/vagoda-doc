# Limitations and Discussion

### Dependence on Third-Party Services

Our project relies heavily on third-party services, especially language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4. While GPT-4 offers advanced natural
language processing capabilities, it's still a general model. This generalization limits its effectiveness in specialized domains, potentially
reducing the accuracy and reliability of AI features tailored for specific e-commerce tasks. Furthermore, the costs associated with utilizing
third-party services like GPT-4 can significantly impact the platform's business efficiency, particularly when widely used.

### Image Generation Models

The deployment of image generation models necessitates a high-configuration infrastructure to ensure both the quality and speed of responses.
Currently, our system does not meet these infrastructure requirements, resulting in slower processing speeds.

### Website System Performance

The existing website system experiences less than optimal page transition smoothness. There is a notable lack of evaluation and measurement
concerning the system's load-bearing capacity and scalability to support a large number of users. This deficiency impacts both the user
experience and the operational efficiency of the system.
