# Buyer Application Interface

Below is the design of how in-app elements look to shoppers in our e-commerce app.

## Navbar

The goal of the Navbar is to ensure that users have an easy and convenient
browsing experience. It can help them quickly find what they need, from
finding their favorite products, checking their cart, managing their account
information, tracking their order, to accessing virtual outfit fitting room, adjusting
personal settings, and being able to log out simply and efficiently.

<br />

Navbar design promotes simplicity, accessibility, and desirability in UI/UX design.
At the same time, the menus are also crucial and useful as the users can get to many important pages from anywhere on the platform.
That completes the user experience, making it more comfortable and convenient while also meeting the requirements for searchability and identification.

## Home

This is where buyers can access most of the platform's features once logged in. The page includes sections for advertisement banners, popular categories, recently accessed products (if available), flash sale products, hot stores, and best-selling products.

Personalized storefronts by sellers create a desire for eye-catching stores, fulfilling one of the key UI/UX design principles.

Each product detail page is carefully designed, providing comprehensive information and high-quality images, creating a perfect online shopping experience. The clear and logical layout across the main sections of the page adheres not only to usability principles but also reflects principles of searchability and discoverability.

Furthermore, users can check reviews or AI-generated review summaries. The AI assistant can process and analyze thousands of user reviews in a short time, providing an accurate and objective overview of the product or service. This helps consumers save time and effort when searching for information, enabling them to make smarter purchasing decisions.

## Cart and Checkout

The checkout flow begins by adding a product to the cart from the homepage, the product information page, or the store's product list.

Additionally, the cost summary, including taxes and shipping fees, is presented transparently, allowing users to accurately grasp the total amount to be paid. The checkout interface is simple yet comprehensive, with clear steps that create a sense of security and convenience for customers as they complete their orders.
