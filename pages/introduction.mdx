# Introduction

E-commerce has become an essential part of modern life thanks to the rapid development of the internet and technology.
Online shopping is now faster and more convenient, but this also raises high demands for optimizing user experience,
improving operational efficiency, and analyzing data to predict trends.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have emerged as advanced technologies that help businesses meet
these demands. Machine Learning automates processes, analyzes large datasets, and provides personalized services, ranging
from image recognition to natural language processing.

## Key Features and Goals

The topic "Exploring and Applying Machine Learning to support business activities" aims to leverage the benefits of AI in
e-commerce. Key features include:

- **Virtual Assistant**: Using large language models and advanced techniques to build an effective chatbot that supports customers.
- **Image Generation Model**: Creating images of people wearing products from photos uploaded by customers, enhancing the shopping
  experience.
- **Product Review Summarization**: Automatically summarizing and analyzing customer reviews to assist in purchasing decisions.

## Implementation Process

1. **Understand Theoretical Foundations**: Study AI and machine learning models such as GPT-4, Stable Diffusion, and OOT
   Diffusion to correctly apply techniques in practice.

2. **Design and Develop the System**: Build a comprehensive e-commerce platform integrating AI features, including system
   architecture design and user interface development.

3. **Testing and Evaluation**: Assess the effectiveness of AI features, gather user feedback, and improve the system based
   on this feedback.

4. **Deployment and Installation**: Implement the system in a real-world environment, ensuring stability and security, and
   evaluate its effectiveness in supporting business operations.

Researching and implementing these features will not only enhance user experience and business efficiency but also open new
opportunities for development in the e-commerce sector.
